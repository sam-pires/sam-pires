Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a product manager with experience in B2B technical products.
Always curious and eager to learn, I enjoy working with ambitious and talented people to deliver best-class products and meaningful experiences.

I previously worked in the Core team at PrestaShop, on the open-source CMS - and at Strapi, the leading open-source headless CMS.

Currently working at [Qonto](https://qonto.com/en).
