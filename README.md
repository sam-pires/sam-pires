Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a product manager with experience in B2B technical products.
Always curious and eager to learn, I enjoy working with ambitious and talented people to deliver best-class products and meaningful experiences.

I worked in the Core team at PrestaShop, on the open-source CMS - and more recently I worked at Strapi, the leading open-source headless CMS.
